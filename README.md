# PARC

Blockchain allows you to see all the interaction done on chain bringing trust in the process. However, for some business use case, we would like to have private information. Introducing PARC, an innovative blockchain-based solution that allows users to create NFTs with public and private content. Users can share confidential information through NFTs and know exactly when the recipient has accessed it. All interactions are secured on-chain, ensuring both transparency and privacy.

## How It Works

- Create an NFT with Public and Private Content: Using PARC, you can mint an NFT that contains both public and private data. The public portion is visible to everyone, but the private content is locked and only accessible to the designated recipient.
- Transfer the NFT: You transfer the NFT to the intended recipient. They can view the public content, but the private information remains encrypted and hidden until the recipient decides to access it.
- Sign a Transaction to Unlock Private Content: To view the private data, the recipient must sign a transaction on-chain. This not only gives them access to the hidden content but also triggers an acknowledgement receipt to the NFT owner, notifying them that the content has been accessed.
- On-Chain Notification: Once the private content is viewed, an immutable record is created on the blockchain, confirming that the recipient has seen the information.
